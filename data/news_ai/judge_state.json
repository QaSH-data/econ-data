      "last_long": "As of headline time (2026-01-03T22:24:46Z) reports state ‘Neizchum’ was hospitalized following a “military nuclear event” and that former President Trump is en route. Identity of Neizchum, the event’s scope, and independent confirmation are not provided in this feed and require verification. If confirmed, historical market behavior favors a near-term risk-off response: equity futures (ES/NQ) typically weaken, Treasuries and gold tend to rally and safe-haven FX can firm, and intraday volatility rises. If the report is unverified or details remain limited, market moves may be muted or reversed once clarity emerges. No trade instructions — await authoritative confirmation and updates."
