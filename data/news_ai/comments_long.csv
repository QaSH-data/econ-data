Mechanism: a less-negative PPI is a marginal “reflation” signal (less upstream price pressure), which can (1) support commodity/cyclical sentiment and Asia risk tone, and (2) slightly reduce the urgency of a pure disinflation narrative that typically supports duration. For US index futures, the impulse is modestly risk-supportive (cyclicals/industrials/energy at the margin), while for Treasuries it can be a small headwind to the safest-duration bid if the tape is already positioned for weak global prices. Why it’s capped: the broader China backdrop still leans toward demand softness/property drag, so this is more likely a short-lived tone shift than a regime change; watch whether follow-through shows up in CNH, base metals and crude as confirmation.",gpt-5.2,1,Headline feed 2026-02-11 | Reuters 2026-02-11
