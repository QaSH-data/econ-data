Separately, JD Vance is the sitting vice president, but there was also no verified reporting found that he vowed to stop all tariffs at this timestamp.

If (and only if) such a resignation were confirmed, the immediate market transmission would likely be: (1) higher volatility and risk aversion (ES/NQ), (2) safe-haven bid into Treasuries (front end and duration, depending on perceived policy continuity), and (3) headline-driven USD moves (DX) via risk + policy uncertainty.

Market framing (if/when confirmed):
- A resignation rumor being debunked typically removes a transient political-risk premium; impact often fades quickly unless accompanied by policy/actionable developments.
- The tariff angle matters more for macro pricing than the resignation-denial itself: anything that keeps tariff uncertainty ‘live’ can feed into inflation-risk narratives and rates sensitivity, especially into the January FOMC window.

That strongly points to either (a) a fabricated headline, (b) a mistranslation/misspelling, or (c) an in-network/internal codename that is not publicly indexable.

Market read: if desks briefly priced a “nuclear threat” off this rumor, a debunk (“no nuclear threat”) typically removes the most acute tail-risk bid—supporting a normalization impulse (risk premia/volatility compression) rather than creating a new macro impulse. However, given the entity ambiguity, the safer posture is to treat this item as non-actionable until a top-tier source (official government statement or major wire) confirms both the original claim and its retraction.
