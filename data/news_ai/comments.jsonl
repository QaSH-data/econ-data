The main transmission is via uncertainty: investors reassess policy/leadership continuity, which can pressure GBP (risk premium and positioning de-risk), and introduce a mild widening impulse for UK rates/credit (gilts and UK spreads) as volatility rises. UK domestically exposed equities (banks, homebuilders, consumer-sensitive names) tend to be most headline-sensitive; large-cap multinationals are typically less direct.\n\nWhy now: leadership-challenge chatter can shift quickly from a single-voice headline into a broader confidence narrative if echoed by MPs/cabinet figures, reflected in polling/betting odds, or paired with fiscal messaging.
