    "US macro impulse flipped firmer: durable goods orders beat with a large headline rebound (+5.3%) and a positive core print, reinforcing a “growth not rolling over” read into the Fed window; this typically pushes yields/real yields up and is a headwind to long-duration equity factor leadership (Durable goods release; Investing.com, Reuters via Investing.com).",
    "Europe growth tone modestly softened: Germany’s Ifo business climate missed expectations and was flat m/m (87.6 vs ~88.2 est), reinforcing a “no momentum” narrative that can marginally support core Europe rates and weigh on EUR; spillover to US risk is second-order unless it coincides with a broader global risk-off tape (Reuters via Investing.com).",
    "Policy-risk bid in havens strengthened: trade-policy escalation rhetoric (Trump tariff threat vs Canada) and renewed US shutdown brinkmanship headlines are being cited alongside the Fed/earnings calendar as drivers of cautious risk positioning; gold’s safe-haven impulse is particularly visible (MarketWatch; AP; Barron’s).",
