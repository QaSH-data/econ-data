    "US risk tone improved mid-week as Trump cooled/paused Greenland-related tariff threats and described a framework with NATO; this reduced immediate trade/geopolitical risk premia after earlier volatility, but follow-through is fragile because details remain unsettled (AP, Yahoo/Finance; Forbes).",
    "Tech/AI-beta sentiment took a hit into Friday’s open after Intel’s results: headline beat but guidance disappointed, weighing Nasdaq futures relative to broader ES (Barron’s; Yahoo/Finance; IBD).",
    "Global macro impulse turned mixed: Eurozone flash PMIs leaned softer on services/composite (growth down / rates-bid impulse), while UK data (retail sales + composite PMI) surprised stronger, pushing UK rate-cut expectations back and leaning global yields modestly higher at the margin (FT).",
