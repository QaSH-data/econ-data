    "AI-capex shock crystalized further via Amazon guiding materially higher 2026 capex (roughly +50% y/y), reinforcing the ‘capex without payback’ narrative that has driven de-rating pressure in software/mega-cap duration proxies (Reuters, FT).",
    "Cross-asset: signs of higher implied uncertainty persist even as futures bounce (vol-sensitive framing in premarket commentary; risk of sharp intraday reversals remains elevated) (Barron’s, Reuters).",
    "Europe growth impulse: Germany industrial production printed a larger-than-expected decline (-1.9% m/m vs -0.3% est per feed), reinforcing EU cyclical downside and biasing global growth/rates tone toward ‘slower-growth’ (NEW info; driver check pending broader confirmation).",
