    "Dominant cross-asset shock shifted toward “policy/regime + rates repricing”: Trump’s move to nominate Kevin Warsh as next Fed chair drove a stronger USD / higher yields impulse and a sharp reversal in precious metals (FT, Barron’s).",
    "Precious-metals deleveraging risk became more immediate: gold and silver saw an outsized downside move tied to USD strength and Fed-chair narrative, raising the probability of VAR/margin-driven spillovers into broader risk (Barron’s).",
    "Macro growth tone weakened from Asia: China’s official Manufacturing PMI fell back into contraction (49.3) and non-manufacturing also dipped below 50, reinforcing global growth-scare channels (Reuters).",
    "Political risk premium widened into the weekend: a partial U.S. government shutdown began Jan 31 with DHS funding dispute unresolved; next step is a House vote expected Monday, adding headline/market-function risk (Guardian).",
    "Geopolitical tail risk increased: Trump comments on sending ships to Iran reintroduce an escalation pathway that can flip correlations (risk-off + crude up + duration bid), even if follow-through is uncertain (Guardian).",
    "Fed-speak skewed hawkish vs near-term cuts: Musalem framing policy as neutral / cuts not warranted pushes against easing expectations and is consistent with the broader USD/real-yield impulse (driver consistent with Warsh/rates narrative; source attribution for Warsh/rates impulse: FT)."

    "Cross-asset stability watch: after the metals air-pocket, the key question is whether deleveraging stays contained (idiosyncratic to metals) or migrates into broader equity vol / systematic flows (Barron’s).",
