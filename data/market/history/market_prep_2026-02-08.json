    "Risk narrative carried over into the weekend: AI-capex/ROI anxiety (esp. hyperscaler spend) + AI-driven disruption fears hit software/tech earlier in the week, but Friday saw a sharp tech-led rebound that looked positioning/sentiment-driven rather than a clean fundamental reset (AP, Barron's).",
    "Cross-asset backdrop: crypto stabilized/rebounded after a drawdown, which eased a marginal risk-sentiment headwind and helped high-beta/tech tone into the close (AP).",
    "Policy/data calendar repriced in focus (not necessarily in rates yet): this week’s cluster of consumer + labor prints (Retail Sales, ECI, NFP/UE) is now the dominant “macro tape” risk, with the market sensitive to whether softer growth = easier Fed vs. recession risk (Investopedia).",

    "Tech duration still the swing factor: despite Friday’s rebound, the market remains “fractured” with Nasdaq lagging; AI infrastructure optimism vs AI-capex payback skepticism is still the key fork for NQ beta and index concentration risk (Barron's, AP).",
    "Gold focus: gold remains primarily a real-rate + policy-expectations + geopolitical-risk proxy; if the week’s data pushes yields/real yields down, gold can stay supported, but risk-on rebounds can temporarily cap safe-haven flows (Reuters via TradingView; Investing.com).",
    "Liquidity/positioning risk: after a high-vol week with sharp factor rotation (tech/software pressure earlier, sharp rebound Friday), systematic flows can amplify post-data moves; watch for outsized index moves without commensurate macro news (Barron's, AP)."
