    "Fed decision delivered a notable signal: 10-2 vote with dissents favoring a 25bp cut (per prior-state feed); this increases perceived internal easing bias and can pull forward cut pricing, supporting duration-sensitive equities while pressuring USD/real yields at the margin (driver: rates repricing).",
    "Oil balance tightened vs expectations (crude draw vs expected build) per EIA surprise; supports energy/commodity inflation tails and can complicate the equity-duration rally if breakevens/real yields re-steepen (LOCAL feed).",
    "Geopolitics: Iran saying it is “ready for dialogue” was a mild de-escalation cue (Reuters); reduces immediate tail-risk premium, but persistence is low and headline-reversal risk remains.",
    "Macro prints this morning: initial jobless claims slightly higher and the November trade deficit widened sharply (BEA, US Dept. of Labor); marginally softer growth impulse into Q4/Q1 tracking and supportive for front-end rates vs a hawkish reprice."
  ],
  "today_focus": [
    "Dominant driver check (today): post-Fed rates/dollar impulse + megacap earnings digestion appears to be setting index-futures tone; mixed Big Tech results (Meta strong, Microsoft weak, Tesla mixed) are driving dispersion inside NQ and keeping headline sensitivity elevated (AP, Yahoo Finance, Barron's).",
    "Gold is being driven primarily by USD weakness / policy credibility narrative (\"weak dollar\" / debasement framing) alongside safe-haven demand; this is the clearest single-asset momentum story today and can feed back into broader risk via real-yield expectations and positioning (Yahoo Finance; note: not independently confirmed by Reuters in this probe).",
    "Oil is bid on renewed Iran-risk framing in parts of the press plus the prior EIA tightness surprise; watch for the inflation-tails channel to re-enter equity pricing if energy strength persists (Guardian live blog; lower source quality vs Reuters/Bloomberg, so treat as secondary).",
    "US data calendar is light after the 08:30 ET releases; focus shifts to microstructure (late-day liquidity, re-hedging after earnings) and any policy headlines (Trump remarks later) that could reinforce USD weakness or tariff/fiscal risk premia."

  "market_pricing": {
    "rates": {
      "fact": "Post-Fed, the market is treating the reaction function as closer to 'hold but with easing faction visible' given reported dissents favoring a cut; today's claims/trade data lean slightly growth-softer.",
      "inference": "Near-term cut odds are likely being pulled forward at the front end, but this is fragile: any upside inflation print (PPI/Core PPI Friday) could quickly reverse the easing repricing."
    },
    "equities": {
      "fact": "Index direction is being set more by megacap earnings dispersion than broad macro today; premarket tone referenced as slightly positive with Big Tech split (AP, Barron's).",
      "inference": "NQ remains more duration/earnings-sensitive than ES; breadth fragility persists because index stability depends on a small set of very large names."
    },
    "fx_usd": {
      "fact": "Multiple market notes cite a weaker USD as a key cross-asset driver, especially for gold (Yahoo Finance).",
      "inference": "If USD weakness is being interpreted as policy preference rather than cyclical rates, it can become self-reinforcing via hedging/asset-allocation flows; that would raise correlation risk (equities up + gold up) until an inflation surprise breaks it."
    },
    "gold": {
      "fact": "Gold strength is being attributed to weak USD and safe-haven/policy narrative in market coverage (Yahoo Finance).",
      "inference": "Positioning risk is elevated: if real yields back up (hawkish repricing or hot inflation), gold can see sharp deleveraging even if geopolitical risk stays noisy."
    },
    "oil_inflation": {
      "fact": "EIA surprise draw (vs expected build) tightens near-term balance (LOCAL feed).",
      "inference": "Sustained oil strength would raise breakeven/inflation-tail sensitivity and is an underpriced risk for equity duration if the market is currently leaning into easing/weak-USD narratives."
