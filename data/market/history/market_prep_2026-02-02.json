    "Dominant cross-asset change: violent precious-metals deleveraging moved from a commodity story into broader risk sentiment, with margin mechanics explicitly cited (CME margin hikes) and forced unwinds/margin calls flagged as the transmission channel into equities/crypto (Reuters).",
    "Policy-path risk re-entered as a first-order driver: Trump’s reported nomination of Kevin Warsh to succeed Powell raised uncertainty about the future Fed reaction function/independence, contributing to rate/FX/commodity volatility and duration-equity sensitivity (Reuters, AP, MarketWatch).",
    "Energy tail risk briefly eased at the margin: headlines/remarks implying Iran talks reduced immediate supply-disruption fear, weighing on oil and removing an inflation-hedge bid that had supported parts of the complex (AP, Washington Post).",
    "Europe data was modestly less-bad: Germany final manufacturing PMI revised up (still <50) and UK final manufacturing PMI slightly higher; marginally supportive for EU/UK risk tone but second-order for US futures vs US rates/data (LOCAL).",
    "New sector-specific headline: reported $12B US strategic minerals stockpile plan lifted critical-minerals/rare-earths risk premia and could rotate flows within equities (materials/defense/industrial supply chain), but unlikely to be the main index driver unless it triggers China response (Bloomberg via Investing.com)."

    "Primary driver check (most consistent across sources): precious-metals rout + deleveraging/forced liquidation spilling into broader risk assets; watch whether selling pressure broadens via VAR/prime-broker constraints and whether miners/commodity-linked credit becomes the stress point (Reuters, MarketWatch).",
    "Secondary driver: Fed leadership/policy-path uncertainty (Warsh nomination narrative) as a volatility amplifier—most likely expressed via real rates, USD, and equity-duration factor rotation (NQ sensitivity > ES) (Reuters, AP).",
    "Key near-term catalyst for rates-risk: today’s ISM Manufacturing and ISM Prices components—market likely to read any upside in prices as “sticky inflation/real-yields up” (risk-negative for duration equities and gold), while activity weakness is “growth scare” (risk-negative but rates can rally) (calendar; mechanism inference).",
    "Gold focus: direction likely dominated by (1) forced selling/position unwind and margin dynamics near-term, versus (2) medium-term macro hedging demand tied to Fed independence/political risk; expect higher intraday elasticity to USD/real yields than usual (Reuters, AP; mechanism inference).",
    "Watch for narrative pivot: if precious-metals stabilization occurs, index focus may revert quickly to earnings concentration and US data cadence; if not, deleveraging remains the umbrella driver (Reuters, MarketWatch)."
