    "US demand tone softened: December retail sales headline and core printed 0.0% m/m vs +0.4% expected, reinforcing a near-term growth downshift narrative and raising sensitivity to any follow-through in labor data (LOCAL).",
    "Rates vs growth cross-currents intensified: softer consumption data should mechanically support a rates-bid/real-yield down impulse (supportive for duration assets) while simultaneously increasing “growth scare” risk for cyclicals/small caps (inference from retail sales miss).",
    "Fed-speak adds optionality risk: Bostic’s “caution on choppy jobs” framing keeps market attention on labor prints as the arbiter for the next policy reprice, increasing odds of intraday whipsaw around jobs/inflation releases (LOCAL; driver confirmation from broader tape remains mixed).",

    "Equity index behavior likely to be “rates-help vs growth-hurt”: if yields fall on weaker data, NQ can be cushioned via duration mechanics, but ES/RTY may lag if the tape interprets the miss as real economy slowdown rather than disinflation (inference).",
    "Gold focus: sensitive to USD/real-yield regime; recent coverage emphasizes dollar weakness and confidence/independence narratives as key supports, but positioning/volatility implies outsized two-way risk on any USD rebound or hawkish repricing (MarketWatch, Reuters).",
    "Earnings microstructure is additive, not primary: large single-name moves (e.g., consumer staples/tech) can tug index futures at the margin, but the macro calendar (jobs + CPI) is the higher-order driver (AP, Barron's, Reuters)."
