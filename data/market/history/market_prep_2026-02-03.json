    "US macro growth surprise: ISM Manufacturing printed 52.6 vs 48.5 forecast, pushing the tape toward “re-acceleration / less growth-scare” and biasing the rates channel (higher yields/real yields = valuation headwind for duration, relative support for cyclicals). (LOCAL; confirm via ISM release flow not independently verified here)",
    "Labor-data schedule shock: BLS delayed the January Employment Situation (originally scheduled Fri Feb 6, 2026) due to the partial government shutdown, removing a key Fed-pricing anchor and pushing markets to substitute ADP/claims/speakers (more path-uncertainty; potentially higher vol risk premia). (AP, CBS)",
    "Treasury cash/issuance guidance: Treasury projected privately-held net marketable borrowing of $109B for Apr–Jun 2026 and targeted end-of-June cash balance (TGA) of ~$900B; near-term implication is front-end liquidity sensitivity via bills/repo and cash-drain optics. (US Treasury)",
    "Mega-cap AI concentration risk: Reuters report that OpenAI has been seeking alternatives to some of Nvidia’s latest chips for inference since 2025, adding idiosyncratic downside uncertainty to NVDA/semis and, by extension, NQ via concentration. (Reuters)",
    "Cross-asset vol backdrop: gold and silver rebounded sharply after a violent selloff linked in reporting to the Kevin Warsh Fed-chair nomination narrative and forced deleveraging/margin dynamics; this keeps ‘precious-metals liquidity’ as an active risk factor for broader risk assets. (FT, Barron's)"

    "Dominant driver check (today Feb 3, 2026): precious-metals rebound + residual forced-liquidation narrative is likely the clearest cross-asset risk driver (gold up strongly in early coverage), with second-order spillover into USD/real-yield and risk-sentiment. (FT, Barron's, Barron's)",
    "US equities (ES/NQ) likely trading a mixed regime: (1) macro ‘growth better’ impulse from strong ISM manufacturing (rates up = duration headwind) versus (2) idiosyncratic NQ weight pressure from NVDA/semis headlines tied to OpenAI inference chip alternatives. (Reuters, Barron's)",
    "Rates as the transmission rail: watch whether the session is ‘risk-on with yields up’ (cyclicals lead, NQ lags) vs ‘risk-on with yields stable/down’ (broad index support). Treasury guidance on TGA/borrowing adds a front-end liquidity lens into the refunding details. (US Treasury, Reuters)",
    "Shutdown/data reliability premium: with NFP delayed, markets may overreact to second-tier labor proxies (ADP tomorrow; claims Thursday), raising intraday convexity in front-end rates and equity duration. (CBS, AP)",
    "Earnings/micro: premarket movers indicate stock-specific dispersion remains high; index direction may be less informative than factor performance (cyclical vs duration; semis vs rest-of-tech). (Barron's)"
