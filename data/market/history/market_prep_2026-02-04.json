    "Policy-tail-risk compression: President Trump signed a ~$1.2T funding package on Feb 3, ending the partial shutdown, but DHS funding is only extended for ~2 weeks (next cliff around Feb 13) so political-risk premium is reduced but not eliminated (Washington Post, Guardian).",
    "Geo-risk reintroduced: U.S. forces shot down an Iranian Shahed-139 drone that approached the USS Abraham Lincoln; adds near-term event-risk bid (oil/defense/safe havens) even if follow-through remains uncertain (AP, Forbes).",
    "Dominant equity narrative shifted back to AI-disruption/tech de-rating: Feb 3 saw a broad tech/software/data-analytics selloff tied to fears that new AI tools could compress pricing power and disrupt incumbents; this is now the key tape driver into today’s session (FT, AP).",
    "Gold/silver volatility remains a live cross-asset risk: sharp rebound after the recent ‘crash’ keeps “margin/forced deleveraging” spillover risk elevated (especially if positioning is still crowded) (Business Insider, Guardian).",

    "Main driver check (today): AI-disruption fear + tech multiple compression remains the dominant equity factor; watch whether the rotation persists (value/defensives holding while growth/AI complex remains heavy) (FT, AP, Yahoo Finance).",
    "Rates impulse catalyst: ISM Services PMI (Feb 4, 10:00 ET) is the cleanest macro trigger for a cross-asset move today; a stronger print risks higher real yields and renewed pressure on duration equities/Nasdaq, while a weaker print could stabilize NQ but may revive growth-scare framing.",
    "Gold focus: treat the metal as a ‘stress barometer’ (liquidity + policy + geopolitics). Today’s risk is not direction but convexity—another large swing can transmit via VAR/margin to broader risk (Business Insider, Guardian).",
    "Earnings tape: mega-cap/AI spending “health check” (Alphabet/other large tech) is the key micro-to-macro link for NQ; downside sensitivity is higher given concentration and recent de-rating (Barron’s, Yahoo Finance).",
    "Geo-risk monitoring: watch for official follow-ups / retaliation headlines around U.S.-Iran maritime/air incidents; even without supply disruption, headline frequency can widen intraday risk premia and support gold (AP)."
