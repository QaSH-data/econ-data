    "Dominant macro change: US January CPI came in softer than expected on the headline (0.2% m/m vs 0.3% est; annual CPI 2.4% vs ~2.5% est), shifting the near-term risk from “upside CPI / higher real yields” toward “downside CPI / lower yields” (WSJ; AP).",
    "Rates impulse: softer CPI + easing core trend (core CPI 2.5% y/y; core 0.3% m/m) supports a modest dovish repricing in policy-path expectations and tends to benefit duration-sensitive equity factors (growth/NDX) and gold via lower real-rate pressure (WSJ).",
    "Risk-premium overlay: prior-session equity tape featured an AI-related de-risking narrative and large end-of-day sell imbalance flows, which can leave fragile positioning even if CPI is supportive (Reuters; Yahoo Finance).",
    "Policy/trade backdrop improved at the margin for semis: US–Taiwan finalized a trade agreement confirming a 15% tariff rate and broader commitments that can be read as incremental supply-chain relief/supportive for semis vs broader tariff uncertainty (Reuters; FT)."

    "Equity factor map: NQ sensitivity to real yields remains the key transmission; if rates rally persists, it should mechanically support duration equities, but fragile sentiment from the AI-led selloff raises whipsaw risk (Reuters; Yahoo Finance).",
