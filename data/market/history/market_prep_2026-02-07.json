    "Dominant tape shift: AI-capex “show-me” skepticism intensified after Amazon guided ~50%+ higher 2026 capex (~$200B), reinforcing the broader Magnificent Seven spend-spree narrative that has been pressuring tech duration/valuation (Reuters, Investopedia).",
    "Cross-asset backdrop leaned risk-defensive earlier in the week: software/tech weakness + softer labor signals (job-cut announcements, higher initial claims) supported a rally in Treasuries and a steeper curve, consistent with the market leaning more into 2026 Fed cuts (WA Trust weekly review).",
    "Friday saw a partial risk rebound (broad equities up; tech stabilization) even as Amazon sold off—suggesting positioning/relief-rally dynamics rather than a clean fundamental all-clear for mega-cap capex ROI (AP, Barron’s).",
    "Gold futures participation cooled into Friday (lower volume/open interest vs prior day), consistent with a market that has been volatile and sensitive to real-rate and risk-sentiment swings (AP).",

    "Rates channel: the market is increasingly sensitive to front-end repricing toward 2026 cuts (curve steepening) on any incremental labor softening—supportive for long-duration equities on yields down, but fragile if inflation expectations re-accelerate (WA Trust weekly review, WSJ).",
    "Gold focus: direction likely to be dictated by real-yield impulses and risk hedging demand; correlations may be unstable given simultaneous ‘Fed cuts’ and ‘inflation expectations’ cross-currents (WSJ, AP).",
    "Weekend/low-liquidity risk: with the prior week featuring sharp factor rotations (defensives vs tech) and elevated narrative uncertainty, gap risk into next week’s data/earnings remains non-trivial (inference; supported by Reuters/Barron’s describing volatile week and tech rout/relief)."
