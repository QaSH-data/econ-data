    "US political tail-risk marginally reduced after Trump signed a partial funding bill; shutdown-risk premium likely compressed at the margin vs earlier in the week (White House, LOCAL).",
    "Risk tone remains fragile into the weekend: gold pushed to fresh records on geopolitics/uncertainty even as US equities ended the week only modestly lower, consistent with lingering hedging demand (Barron's; AP).",

    "Rates/real-yield channel remains the main transmission: any hawkish-leaning Fed communication or inflation-reacceleration read-through would be most punitive for NQ vs ES; conversely, growth-soft data that cools yields would mechanically help long-duration equities but may be interpreted as earnings-risk if broadening (inference; AP for risk tone context).",
    "Gold focus: safe-haven bid looks more narrative-driven than data-driven right now; watch for any de-escalation headlines that could unwind hedges quickly, versus escalation that could spill into equities via risk-premium rather than growth (Barron's; AP)."

      "Gap risk from weekend/off-hours policy headlines (trade/tariffs/geopolitics): could re-open quickly with thin liquidity and create cross-asset discontinuity (inference; supported by persistent ‘nervousness’/gold behavior in AP/Barron's).",
      "Correlation risk: an adverse mix where equities weaken while yields/real rates rise (tightening financial conditions) is a plausible stress path if the Fed leans hawkish or inflation expectations tick up (inference).",
      "Earnings contagion risk: if one or two mega-caps signal AI capex/margin pressure, it can propagate through NQ via concentration and factor crowding more than fundamentals (inference)."
