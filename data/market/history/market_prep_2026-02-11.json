    "Primary macro impulse shifted to a labor/rates repricing: January jobs data beat expectations with unemployment at 4.3%, pushing front-end yields up and reducing near-term easing expectations (FT; input headline).",
    "Counterpoint in the same release: annual benchmark revisions reportedly marked prior-year payroll growth materially lower, complicating the ‘tight labor’ signal and keeping two-way rates volatility elevated into CPI (FT).",
    "Rates narrative was already fragile from the prior session: weak retail sales fueled a cuts-friendly interpretation and pulled yields down before the jobs print, setting up whipsaw conditions across equities and gold (Bloomberg).",
    "Gold’s driver mix remains split between real-rate/dollar moves and geopolitical risk premium tied to U.S.-Iran enforcement/tanker headlines; this can decouple gold from equities intraday (Reuters; Barron’s)."

    "Dominant driver today: front-end rates repricing off the January jobs report (tightness vs expectations), with equity index futures sensitivity highest in duration-heavy Nasdaq (FT; Reuters).",

    "Fed speak cluster risk: Schmid/Bowman/Hammack today can either validate the rates backup (hawkish pushback on cuts) or re-open easing optionality if they emphasize revisions/soft demand (calendar; Reuters context).",

      "Front-end yields are the transmission channel: higher 2y/real yields mechanically tighten financial conditions for NQ and can cap gold if USD is firm; revisions can invert that quickly if interpreted as growth slowdown (FT).",
