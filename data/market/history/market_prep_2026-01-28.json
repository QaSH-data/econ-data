    "Late-session equity microstructure was supply-heavy: large MOC sell imbalances (S&P, Nasdaq, Mag7) flagged close-to-open volatility risk around headlines (LOCAL).",
    "Geopolitics toggled from de-escalation optics (Saudi non-participation signal) to renewed escalation rhetoric: Trump said “time is running out” for Iran (LOCAL). Net effect: wider tail-risk distribution (risk-off impulse if rhetoric escalates further; risk-on relief if no follow-through).",
    "Overnight global rates input: Australia CPI ran hotter than expected on some measures, adding a mild upward bias to global yields via cross-market repricing/relative-value flows (LOCAL).",
