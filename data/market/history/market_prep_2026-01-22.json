    "Policy-risk premium swung meaningfully: Trump headline flow around Greenland/NATO plus the explicit statement that Feb 1 tariffs would not be imposed (as reported broadly in real-time coverage) shifted the tape from headline-risk to relief-risk; this likely compressed near-term trade/geopolitical tail hedges vs prior baseline (Guardian).",
    "Fed independence tail risk partially capped: Supreme Court appeared wary of Trump’s bid to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, reducing immediate odds of a governance shock even if the broader politicization theme remains (Bloomberg via Yahoo Finance).",

    "Dominant driver check (today/session): policy-risk relief vs rates repricing. Relief impulse from tariff walkback/Greenland de-escalation is risk-supportive, but claims resilience keeps the market sensitive to real-rate moves and any inflation stickiness in the data run-up (Guardian; NEW local claims headline).",
    "Gold focus: gold remains supported by macro/policy uncertainty + demand narratives (banks upgrading forecasts), but near-term direction is still most sensitive to USD/real-rate swings around US data and any reversal of geopolitical/trade tension headlines (MarketWatch; Business Insider; Guardian).",
    "Rates-first routing for NQ vs ES: if yields/real rates back up on “sticky inflation + resilient labor,” NQ should remain the higher-beta expression (discount-rate sensitivity) even if headline policy risk fades; if yields ease, relief can broaden (inference anchored by claims + macro setup).",
    "Headline/judicial micro-catalyst: any follow-through headlines on Fed governance (Cook case) or Fed-chair speculation can reprice term premia/vol without needing hard macro data (Bloomberg via Yahoo Finance)."
