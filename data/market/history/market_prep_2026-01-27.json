    "Policy shock escalated: Trump said he would raise tariffs on South Korean goods (autos/lumber/pharma) to 25% from 15%, injecting fresh trade-policy risk premium and cross-asset hedging demand (Reuters).",
    "Tech/AI supply-chain narrative broadened: Microsoft unveiling an in-house AI chip adds a new angle to the “AI capex + GPU dependency” debate, raising dispersion risk inside mega-cap/semis and potentially increasing NQ idiosyncratic beta to chip headlines (LOCAL).",

    "Gold focus: safe-haven bid and pre-Fed positioning appear to be the framing; if real yields/dollar firm on hawkish Fed read-through, gold becomes the stress-test of ‘risk-off but rates-up’ correlation (Yahoo Finance).",
    "US data at 10:00 ET: Conference Board Consumer Confidence + Richmond Fed—used as a last “growth tone” input before the FOMC blackout feel; could matter mainly through front-end rate expectations and equity-duration sensitivity (calendar)."
