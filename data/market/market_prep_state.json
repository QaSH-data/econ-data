    "Rates whipsaw around the US labor + CPI cluster (Feb 11 jobs; Feb 13 CPI): real-yield impulse can flip ES/NQ and drive gold convexity (especially if data conflict).",
    "Growth-scare repricing: retail sales miss becomes a broader consumer slowdown narrative, weighing ES cyclicals/RTY even if yields fall (bad-good data paradox).",
    "Gold positioning/liquidity air-pocket: elevated recent volatility increases probability of disorderly moves on USD spikes, real-yield jumps, or headline shocks.",
    "Fed communication risk: speaker tone (Logan/Hammack/Bowman etc.) could push back on easing pricing after weak activity data, triggering rate back-up and duration drawdown.",
    "Second-order political risk spillover (UK leadership noise): mostly GBP/gilts risk, but can contaminate global risk sentiment if it escalates into policy/fiscal uncertainty."
