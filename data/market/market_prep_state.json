    "Rates whipsaw into CPI: conflicting signals (stronger headline jobs vs downward benchmark revisions + soft retail sales) create two-way risk in front-end and real yields, amplifying ES/NQ and gold volatility.",
    "CPI ‘upside surprise’ risk underpriced relative to complacent cuts narrative after soft retail sales; could force abrupt de-risking in duration equities and pressure gold via real-yield jump.",
    "CPI ‘downside surprise’ risk: could reignite aggressive easing expectations and steepen risk-on into NQ, but also signal demand weakness that later flips into growth-scare (bad-good paradox).",
    "Geopolitical tail (Iran/shipping enforcement) adds fat-tail risk to oil and safe-haven flows; can produce cross-asset correlation breaks (gold bid even if yields firm).",
    "Treasury auction tails (10y/30y) provoke term-premium jump and equity duration hit, independent of macro data direction."
