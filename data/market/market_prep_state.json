    "Rates whipsaw around the Tue/Wed macro cluster (Retail Sales + ECI + NFP/UE): can flip ES/NQ and gold reactions intraday via real-yield impulse.",
    "Nasdaq fragility / factor concentration: if the market re-focuses on AI-capex/ROI concerns, NQ downside can outpace ES even without broad risk-off.",
    "Gold correlation regime risk: recent extreme precious-metals moves imply higher probability of disorderly positioning-driven selloffs on USD/real-yield spikes.",
    "Headline/geopolitical tail (e.g., Iran-related risk) amplifies oil → inflation expectations channel, complicating the interpretation of 'growth vs inflation' data surprises.",
    "Liquidity/positioning air-pocket after sharp rebound: early-session gaps and fast trend moves more likely around data releases."
