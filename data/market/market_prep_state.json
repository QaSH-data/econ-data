    "Residual forced deleveraging from gold/silver volatility reappears (margin calls / higher margins / liquidity gaps), spilling into equities (esp. high-beta) and credit via VAR-driven de-grossing.",
    "Rates re-acceleration regime: strong ISM keeps upward pressure on yields/real yields, compressing equity duration multiples (NQ vulnerability) even if headline indices look stable.",
