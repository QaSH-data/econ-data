    "Policy-regime repricing whipsaw: Warsh nomination interpreted as (a) hawkish -> cuts priced out, USD/real yields up, NQ pressured; or (b) reduces Fed-independence tail fears -> vol compresses; two-way risk is elevated until more details/confirmation path is clear.",
    "Positioning/technical liquidation in precious metals spills into broader risk: the gold/silver reversal could trigger margin/VAR-driven de-leveraging across risk assets if volatility persists.",
    "Earnings concentration/breadth shock: megacap-driven index moves remain outsized; a single large print can dominate ES/NQ regardless of macro.",
    "Europe inflation surprise (Germany prelim CPI hotter) complicates global duration relief; if bund yields rise meaningfully it can tighten global financial conditions and cap US equity multiples.",
    "Geopolitical headline reversal (Iran/oil): can quickly reintroduce inflation-risk framing and risk-off correlations, conflicting with the current Fed-cuts narrative."
