    "AI-capex shock broadens into sustained tech-duration de-rating (multiple compression + FCF optics), pulling NQ/ES via concentration even if economic data is mixed.",
    "Rates whipsaw: growth-slowdown data pushes yields down (supports equities) but any rebound in longer-run inflation expectations reverses the move, hitting NQ and destabilizing gold hedging behavior.",
    "Labor-data uncertainty/processing risk after recent disruptions (delays/revisions) increases the chance of a sharp repricing in front-end rates on release day.",
    "Systematic/positioning air-pockets: high dispersion and rapid factor rotations elevate the risk of liquidity-driven extensions (both directions) around key prints/mega-cap headlines.",
    "Gold market volatility transmits into broader VAR/margin dynamics (forced selling) if macro shock causes simultaneous equity and precious-metals drawdown."
