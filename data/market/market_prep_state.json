    "CPI-driven dovish repricing proves fragile (base effects / one-off components); any hotter follow-up data forces a fast rates unwind (yields up), pressuring NQ and potentially gold via higher real yields.",
    "AI-capex/AI-disruption narrative deepens into a broader megacap de-grossing; index-level downside transmission via concentrated weights (NQ especially) even if macro data is benign.",
    "Holiday-thinned liquidity and post-holiday gap risk: headline sensitivity increases and intraday depth can be poor, amplifying moves in ES/NQ and gold futures around any surprise macro/policy headlines.",
    "Cross-asset correlation snap: a sharp move in yields (auction dynamics / risk-off bid) cascades into equities and gold simultaneously, raising hedging error for balanced books."
