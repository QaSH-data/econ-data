    "AI-capex shock broadens into a deeper tech-duration de-rating (software + mega-cap) and drags index-level risk via concentration; rebounds get sold as ‘capex-without-monetization’ narrative persists",
    "UoM inflation expectations surprise higher → front-end reprices hawkish, real yields up → NQ underperforms and gold pressured (or gold rallies on policy-credibility fears; correlation unstable)",
    "Vol-control / systematic deleveraging into Friday close amplifies any downside impulse; liquidity air-pockets possible if another mega-cap headline hits",
    "EU growth downside (Germany IP) feeds a renewed global growth scare narrative; cyclicals/industrials weaken while rates rally, creating cross-asset whipsaw",
    "Gold/metal volatility transmits into broader VAR/margin dynamics (forced selling), causing simultaneous pressure in equities and precious metals"
