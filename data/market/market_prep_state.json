    "US CPI (Feb 13) upside surprise drives abrupt real-yield repricing; hits duration equities (NQ) and can pressure gold via higher real rates (dominant near-term tail).",
    "US CPI downside surprise triggers aggressive easing expectations (risk-on initially) but raises growth-scare interpretation risk; can create whipsaw across ES/NQ and rates.",
    "30-year auction tails (weak demand) steepens long end/raises term premium; negative for rate-sensitive equities independent of CPI direction.",
    "Fiscal/deficit narrative (CBO outlook) reasserts as a market driver, reinforcing term-premium drift higher and crowding out duration risk appetite.",
    "Earnings dispersion shock: large single-name gaps (notably in tech/comm services) spill into NQ index volatility even if macro is quiet intraday."
