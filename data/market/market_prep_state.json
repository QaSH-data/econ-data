    "FOMC communication shock (hawkish-hold lifts real yields -> pressures Nasdaq-duration; dovish-hold can reflate duration but destabilize USD/gold correlations).",
    "Trade-policy escalation/contagion from South Korea tariff threat into broader tariff actions, raising stagflation-style risk (equities down while yields up) or abrupt risk-off with safe-haven bid.",
    "Mega-cap earnings concentration risk (index-level gaps driven by a handful of tech names; NQ vs ES divergence and overnight headline gaps).",
    "Gold positioning air-pocket risk: if Fed messaging or data lifts real yields/USD quickly, gold could see mechanical profit-taking despite elevated geopolitical/policy uncertainty.",
    "Late-day liquidity/auction sensitivity (imbalance-driven moves and gamma effects) amplifying otherwise modest macro impulses."
