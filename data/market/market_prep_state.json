    "Interpretation risk: CPI downside surprise is partly base-effects; if subsequent prints re-accelerate, the market could rapidly unwind dovish repricing (rates up, NQ down; gold pressured via real yields).",
    "AI/tech de-grossing persists despite CPI relief; factor rotation becomes disorderly, keeping NQ volatility elevated and correlation spikes in index futures.",
    "Flow/positioning risk: after large sell-side close imbalances and a weak prior tape, intraday liquidity pockets can amplify moves around headline follow-through (rates + megacap).",
    "Trade-policy headline risk remains two-sided: US–Taiwan agreement helps semis at the margin, but broader tariff escalation/retaliation remains a latent macro shock channel."
