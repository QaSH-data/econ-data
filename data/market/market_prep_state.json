    "FOMC communication shock: market expecting a hold; asymmetric risk is a hawkish hold (higher real yields) compressing equity duration and pressuring NQ; dovish hold could weaken USD and extend gold bid but risks ‘bad growth’ framing for cyclicals.",
    "Geopolitical escalation premium (Iran rhetoric) resurfaces: could lift crude risk premium and raise inflation-risk tails, complicating the post-FOMC rates/equity reaction.",
    "Mega-cap concentration/breadth fragility: index resilience masking sector drawdowns; earnings or guidance misses in a few large names can gap ES/NQ despite benign macro.",
    "Gold positioning vulnerability: if the Fed outcome re-prices real yields higher or stabilizes USD, gold could see fast deleveraging even if geopolitical risk remains.",
    "Late-day liquidity + auction sensitivity: prior MOC sell imbalance and event-day hedging can amplify otherwise modest headlines into outsized index moves."
