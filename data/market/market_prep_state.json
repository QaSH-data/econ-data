    "Escalation/retaliation cycle: concrete tariff timetable (10% from Feb with potential escalation later) increases likelihood of European countermeasures, prolonging risk-off and complicating inflation expectations.",
    "Adverse cross-asset regime: equities draw down while long-end yields rise, causing valuation compression (esp. Nasdaq) and tightening financial conditions.",
    "Headline-gap / liquidity air-pocket risk around political statements and Davos-related soundbites; systematic flows may amplify whipsaws.",
    "Gold whipsaw risk: safe-haven premium vulnerable to sudden détente headlines; alternatively can extend if trade risk morphs into stagflation narrative.",
    "Macro data reprice risk: core PCE and PMI could override tariffs narrative temporarily by moving real rates; upside inflation surprise would be particularly toxic for NQ and supportive for gold via uncertainty channel."
