    "Rates whipsaw around Tue/Wed macro cluster (Retail Sales + ECI + NFP/UE): 'growth scare' vs 'sticky inflation/wages' can flip the sign of equity and gold reactions intraday.",
    "AI-capex/ROI narrative shock: guidance/headlines can re-open duration de-rating in NQ even if top-line demand is strong (FCF optics, margin anxiety).",
    "Government funding/shutdown tail: DHS funding deadline can produce headline volatility and/or distort data timing, increasing probability of 'false signal' macro prints and abrupt repricing.",
    "Gold 'failed hedge' episode: if real yields rise on upside inflation/wage surprise, gold drawdown can coincide with equity weakness, tightening financial conditions via margin/VAR effects.",
    "Positioning air-pocket after a sharp Friday rebound: thin Sunday liquidity + heavy macro week can exaggerate overnight futures gaps and early-session trend moves."
