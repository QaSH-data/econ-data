    "Fed-chair nomination path creates prolonged regime-uncertainty premium (confirmation timing, Senate optics, perceived independence) -> volatile repricing of real yields/USD and duration equity multiples.",
    "Precious-metals deleveraging spills into broader risk via margin/VAR (systematic de-grossing) rather than fundamentals.",
    "Partial government shutdown extends beyond the weekend and begins to disrupt data releases / agency functions, increasing macro-data uncertainty and policy headline risk.",
    "China slowdown signal deepens (PMIs <50) -> global growth scare, cyclicals/commodities down, safety bid in duration; can conflict with any geopolitics-driven oil/inflation impulse.",
    "Iran escalation headlines over the weekend reprice oil risk premium and revive inflation-risk framing (risk-off + energy up + long-end volatility)."
