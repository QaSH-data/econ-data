    "Tech-duration de-rating continues (AI disruption narrative broadens beyond ‘AI winners’ into software/analytics incumbents), dragging NQ and spilling into ES via concentration and risk-parity deleveraging",
    "Rates re-acceleration on a strong ISM Services (and/or higher prices-paid), lifting real yields and compressing equity multiples; gold may not hedge cleanly if USD/real yields dominate",
    "Gold/silver volatility triggers margin/VAR shocks → forced selling across equities/credit (correlations spike, intraday liquidity gaps)",
    "U.S.–Iran incident follow-through (retaliation, shipping disruption headlines) lifts risk premia; oil up / equities down / gold up pattern, but highly headline-dependent",
    "Shutdown ‘ended’ but DHS funding cliff around Feb 13 reintroduces political/policy uncertainty; risk premium can reappear quickly as the deadline approaches"
