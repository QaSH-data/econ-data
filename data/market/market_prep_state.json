    "Inflation re-acceleration/tails reprice via PPI/Core PPI: could push real yields higher, pressure NQ duration and force gold/weak-USD narratives to unwind",
    "Megacap earnings concentration/breadth shock: a small number of large names can gap ES/NQ regardless of macro; dispersion increases hedging demand and intraday reversals",
    "USD-policy headline risk: rhetoric interpreted as endorsing a weaker dollar can accelerate gold/commodity moves and destabilize cross-asset correlations",
    "Geopolitical headline reversal (Iran): dialogue signals can fade quickly; any escalation can reinsert oil/safe-haven bid and tighten financial conditions abruptly",
    "Market-on-close imbalance / liquidity air pockets: late-day flow can dominate tape and exaggerate headline reactions, especially after large earnings moves"
