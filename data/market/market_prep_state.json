    "Fed independence / policy-path uncertainty persists beyond the nomination headline (confirmation timing, Powell role, political/legal rhetoric) leading to elevated rate-vol and multiple compression risk for duration equities (NQ > ES).",
    "Shutdown extends longer than expected or meaningfully disrupts key data releases, increasing 'macro signal noise' and raising whipsaw risk around ISM/JOLTS/ADP.",
    "Metals-driven deleveraging: higher margins + recent drawdowns trigger forced selling and cross-asset VAR shocks (gold, miners, broader risk).",
    "Iran escalation tail: oil spikes further, forcing inflation expectations/real yields higher and tightening financial conditions into a fragile risk backdrop.",
    "Earnings concentration risk: a small set of mega-cap/AI-adjacent prints drives index-level moves; disappointment could amplify downside via crowded positioning and vol-control de-risking."
